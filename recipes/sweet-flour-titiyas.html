    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A staple for Chamorro fiesta tables. This easy to make sweet flour titiyas pairs well with chicken kelaguen.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>&frac34; cup coconut milk &#40;see note below&#41;</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup melted butter</li>
        <li>&frac14; to &frac12; cup cream of coconut &#40;the sweet one, used for mixed drinks&#41;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>NOTE: If you don't find or have any cream of coconut, just increase the coconut milk to 1 cup, and add &frac12; cup white granulated sugar. Follow the rest of the instructions below.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients together in a large mixing bowl. Add the coconut milk, melted butter, and cream of coconut &#40;start out with &frac14; cup; increase to a total of &frac12; cup, depending on how humid your day is-more humid means less liquid&#41. Mix together until a dough forms; knead gently to form a smooth ball of dough.</li>

        <li>Break off golf-ball sized pieces. Flour your rolling surface and rolling pin. Roll out the piece of dough into a flat disc &#40;about &frac18;-inch thick&#41;. Place the titiyas on a dry skillet; prick all over with a fork to prevent bubbling during the cooking process.</li>

        <li>Pan-fry on a dry skillet over medium-low heat for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the bottom begins to turn a golden brown; flip over and cook the other side until it turns a nice golden brown. For thicker titiyas, cook over low heat for 4-5 minutes on each side; the titiyas is done when you gently press down on the center and it feels somewhat firm to the touch.</li>

        <li>Place cooked titiyas on a plate covered with clean kitchen towel to keep warm. Serve with chicken kelaguen. Enjoy!</li>
